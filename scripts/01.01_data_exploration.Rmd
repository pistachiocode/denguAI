## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{python}
import os
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import dengue_utils as dutils
import dsutils as du

os.chdir("/Users/rocio/Dropbox/DataScience/dengAI/scripts")

features_train = pd.read_csv(dutils.FEATURES_TRAIN_PATH)
labels_train = pd.read_csv(dutils.LABELS_TRAIN_PATH)

features_test = pd.read_csv(dutils.FEATURES_TEST_PATH)


# Join of train features and labels features

train_dataset = features_train.merge(labels_train, 
                                    left_on=['city', 'year', 'weekofyear'], 
                                    right_on=['city', 'year', 'weekofyear'],
                                    how='inner')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
